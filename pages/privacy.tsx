            relationships may include operating a co-branded website or web
            pages with a strategic partner. You should be aware that these
            co-branded sites may collect different or additional information.

            we provide our postal mailing list (consisting of customer names and
            postal mailing addresses, email addresses) to other companies whose
            products we believe may be of interest to you. In order to determine
            those products that we believe may be of interest to you, the

            combined with other personally identifiable information (such as
            demographic information and past purchase history) available from

            information in order to comply with a subpoena, court order,
            administrative or governmental order, or any other requirement of
            law, or when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary in
            order to protect our rights or the rights of others, to prevent harm
            to persons or property, to fight fraud and credit risk reduction. We
            use non-personally identifiable information in the aggregate, so
            that we can improve the Site and for business and administrative
            purposes. We may also use or share with third parties for any
            purpose aggregated data that contains no personally identifiable

            <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
            <p>We are committed to
            protecting the information we receive from you. We follow reasonable
            technical and management practices to help protect the
            confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our

            problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. The

            your information in order to perform their duties are allowed such
            access. Accessing And Updating Your Personal Information And
            Preferences If you are a registered user, you may access and update
            your registration information and your preferences to receive email
